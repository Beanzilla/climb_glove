# climb_glove
Adds magic gloves which allow you to climb up on things

## What's in the box

- 2 pairs of gloves (one requires you to be pointing at nodes or entities, the other doesn't require anything)
- Supports Minetest Game and Mineclone (2, 5 & Mineclonia)

## How to climb

With a basic glove just look at say some nodes (like a tree), then just rapidly click the punch key (left mouse button by default).

> The only difference between the basic glove and advanced glove is that the advanced doesn't need you looking at anything.
